Q1)What is the time complexity of the following code :

        int a = 0, i = N;
        while (i > 0) {
            a += i;
            i /= 2;
        }

        soln:

        Time complexety: Big O(N)

        Explanation:

        for every iteration i, becomes i/2
        more explicitly, if i=N then i becomes  N/2,N/4,N/6,... or in general , N/(2^x) for x iterations

        thus , when i<=0 or i<1 ,the loop terminates then,  N/(2^x) <  1
        -> N< (2^x)
        ->  log(N) < xlog(2)
        -> (log(N)/log(2))< x
        -> log2(N) < x

        so, at last when x=log2(N) , that will be the last iteration of the loop.

Q2)What is time complexity of following code :

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = N; i > 0; i /= 2) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                count += 1;
            }
        }


soln:


for 1st iteration loop will iterate n times…

for 2nd iteration loop will iterate n/2 times…
for 3rd iteration loop will iterate n/4 times…
for 4th iteration loop will iterate n/8 times… and so on…
so here O(f(n)) = n + n/2 + n/4 + n/8 + n/16 + …
=> O(f(n)) = n + 1/2( n + n/2 + n/4 + n/8 + n/16 + …)
=> O(f(n)) = n + 1/2O(f(n))
=> 1/2O(f(n)) = n
=> O(f(n)) = 2n
therefore time complexity will be O(n)


Q3)What is the time complexity of the following code :

int i, j, k = 0;
for (i = n/2; i <= n; i++) {
    for (j = 2; j <= n; j = j * 2) {
         k = k + n/2;
    }
}

soln:

lets start from inner loop:
starting fron 2 and ending by N; every time multipling by 2. so it would be 2, 4, 8, 16, ... N; that is 2^x = N resulting in x = log2(N)

now outer loop:
starting from N/2 to N every step increment by 1 means : N-N/2 resulting in N/2 steps.

So N/2 * log2(N); becomes O(Nlog2N)
