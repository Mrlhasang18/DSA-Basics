Q)What is the time complexity of the following code :

        int j = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            while(j < n && arr[i] < arr[j]) {
                j++;
            }
        }

ans: O(N)

Initially j=0 

loop starts with i=0 and j=0 too so arr[j]!>arr[i] , hence the loop will not run.
i=1 still j=0 , loop will run j will become 1 and then both i=j=1 hence loop will not run.
i=2 , j=1 loop will run j become 2, then i=j=2, hence loop will not run .
and just like that at every i loop will run only once 
hence time complexity is a function of O(n).
