What is the time, space complexity of following code :

        int a = 0, b = 0;    
        for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            a = a + rand();  
        }
        for (j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            b = b + rand();
        }
Assume that rand() is O(1) time, O(1) space function.

ans: for the first loop time complexity is Big O(N) and for second loop Big O(M), since N and M are independent vvaribles so the time complexity is O(M+N)
     As for the space complexity , var size doesnot depend upon the input size so space complexity is O(1).
