1.FOR LOOP
What is the time, space complexity of following code :

        int a = 0, b = 0;    
        for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            a = a + rand();  
        }
        for (j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            b = b + rand();
        }
Assume that rand() is O(1) time, O(1) space function.

ans: for the first loop time complexity is Big O(N) and for second loop Big O(M), since N and M are independent vvaribles so the time complexity is O(M+N)
     As for the space complexity , var size doesnot depend upon the input size so space complexity is O(1).

2.NESTED FOR LOOP

What is the time, space complexity of following code :

int a = 0, b = 0; 
for (i = 0; i < N; i++) { 
    for (j = 0; j < N; j++) { 
        a = a + j; 
    } 
} 
for (k = 0; k < N; k++) { 
    b = b + k; 
}

SOLN: Big O(N*N) , O(1)
  The inner loop depends on outer loop input so that T(N) = N*N = O(N*N)
The programer doesn't use extra memroy base on input so that S(N) = S(1) = O(1) 

or 
Because first loop is nested with same input its N^2 and for another loop its O(N). Hence, Highest order is considered,
Therefore, T(n) = O(N*N).
No extra space related to input is occupied, hence it space complexity is O(1)
