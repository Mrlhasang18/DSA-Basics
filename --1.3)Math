Q1)What is the time complexity of the following code :

        int a = 0, i = N;
        while (i > 0) {
            a += i;
            i /= 2;
        }

        soln:

        Time complexety: Big O(N)

        Explanation:

        for every iteration i, becomes i/2
        more explicitly, if i=N then i becomes  N/2,N/4,N/6,... or in general , N/(2^x) for x iterations

        thus , when i<=0 or i<1 ,the loop terminates then,  N/(2^x) <  1
        -> N< (2^x)
        ->  log(N) < xlog(2)
        -> (log(N)/log(2))< x
        -> log2(N) < x

        so, at last when x=log2(N) , that will be the last iteration of the loop.
